    <!-- Understand that any object you would like the IOC container to manager the lifecycle of
    can be defined as a bean. So how do you define a bean? 
    
    When defining a bean, it is good practice to give it a logical name that you can use to
    reference it. You should also what the type of the bean is using the "class" attribute. Also
    be aware of the fact that Spring Beans are by default "singletons". This means that there will
    only be one instance of this bean created. Of course, you can change the bean scope. One other
    option, for instance, is "prototype", which creates a new instance each time the bean is requested.-->
   <!-- <bean name="recipeRepository" class="com.revature.repository.RecipeRepository" scope="singleton"></bean> -->
        
    <!-- We should not be using the getBean() to grab beans from the container. Instead, we should
    be "wiring" our beans together. This just means that we will be creating relationships between
    our beans.-->
    <!-- 
    <bean name="recipeService" class="com.revature.service.RecipeService">
    We can explicitly wire our beans together using the "property" tag. We are telling the
    IOC container that the recipeService has a property. The "ref" property denotes that we are
    referencing another bean in this container.
    <property name="recipeRepository" ref="recipeRepository"/>
     We can also use constructor injection like so:
    <constructor-arg index="0" ref="recipeRepository"></constructor-arg>
    </bean> -->
    
    <!-- Thus far, we've done what is considered "manual bean wiring". That said, Spring also allows
    for "autowiring". This means that you can just tell the IOC container which beans are candidates
    for being wired in.
    
    As far as autowiring is concerned, there are multiple strategies. You can autowire:
    
    byName: Spring looks for a bean of a specific name in the IOC container and chooses a bean name
    that matches the property name. This is the most specific way of autowiring.
    
    byType: Spring looks for a bean of a specific type in the IOC container. If there are multiple
    beans of that type in the container, you should NOT choose to wire this way.
    
    constructor: Similar to byType, but instead Spring looks for a bean of a specific type in the IOC
    container based on your constructor arguments.-->
   <!--  <bean name="recipeService2" class="com.revature.service.RecipeService" autowire="byName">
    </bean> -->
</beans>
